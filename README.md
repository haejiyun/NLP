## [Python/Streamlit] Sentiment Analysis with NLP

**Techniques**: Zero-shot Classification, BERT Sentiment Analysis

This project aims to analyze Airbnb guest experiences in Paris over various time periods by applying advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to guest reviews. By integrating different NLP tasks, the study provides comprehensive insights and a detailed overview of guest sentiments and experiences. The results of this analysis were presented through an interactive Streamlit application.

The NLP pipeline utilized includes:
Language Detection, identifying the language of each review.
Translation, converting non-English reviews into English.
Sentiment Analysis, using state-of-the-art transformer models like BERT to determine the sentiment of the reviews.
Multi-label Classification, employing zero-shot classification to categorize review content into multiple relevant categories without the need for extensive labeled training data.
